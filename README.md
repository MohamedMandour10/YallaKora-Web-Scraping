# YallaKora Web Scraping
This is a Python script that scrapes football match information from the YallaKora website and saves the data in a CSV file.

## Prerequisites
* Python 3
* Beautiful Soup 4
* Requests

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash

pip install beautifulsoup4 
pip install requests
pip install lxml
```
## Usage
Run the script in a terminal window:

```bash
python YallaKora_Web_Scraping.py
```
The script will prompt the user to enter a date in the format of MM/DD/YYYY. The script will then scrape match information for that date from the YallaKora website and save the data in a CSV file named match_info.csv.
